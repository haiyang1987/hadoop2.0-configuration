hadoop2.0-configuration
=======================

a simple linux shell, just for my blog - http://www.cnblogs.com/meibenjin/p/3172889.html

Tips:
  please change the variable src_dir and hadoop_dir if necessary. 
  src_dir is the root directory of hadoop source code.
  hadoop_dir is the root directory of hadoop environment. 
  please visit the link above for details.
